// Package agent is the CertPilot host agent: the part that runs on the machines
// where certificates actually live.
//
// It exists because those machines are the ones nothing can reach inwards, and
// because the private key should never have travelled to them in the first
// place. Everything here is built around one property that the rest of the
// system cannot provide on its own:
//
//	The keys are generated on the host and never leave it.
//
// The agent's own identity key is the first instance of that, not an exception
// to it. It is generated during enrolment, the public half is sent, and the
// private half stays in a file on the host for the life of the agent.

# CertPilot development

Orientation lives in [`CLAUDE.md`](../../../CLAUDE.md) and is loaded every
session. This is the deeper layer: how to actually do the work here without
rediscovering it.

Read [`docs/`](../../../docs/README.md) before source. It is written, current,
and someone verified every claim in it against the code.

## Screenshotting an authenticated page

`--screenshot` cannot sign in and inherits the system appearance, which is why
the light theme went unverified for so long. Drive Chrome over CDP instead —
Node 22+ has a global `WebSocket`, so nothing needs installing:

```
chrome --headless --remote-debugging-port=9222 --remote-allow-origins='*' \
       --user-data-dir=/tmp/prof about:blank &
```

Then `POST /api/v1/auth/login` with `fetch`, take the `certpilot_session` cookie
out of `Set-Cookie`, and plant it with `Network.setCookie` — it is httpOnly, so
the page cannot be made to set it. `Emulation.setEmulatedMedia` with
`prefers-color-scheme` forces either theme regardless of the system.

A working copy is in the session scratchpad as `theme-shot.mjs`.

## Running and verifying

### The loop that catches real defects

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh &          # ~10s to a listening API
./scripts/seed-demo.sh      # a realistic estate; idempotent
# ... make a change ...
curl -s localhost:8080/api/v1/certificates | python3 -m json.tool | head
```

Then stop it by signalling the **process group**, not the script — `go run`
spawns a compiled binary as a child and killing the parent orphans it:

```bash
PG=$(ps -o pgid= -p $(pgrep -f "scripts/dev.sh" | head -1) | tr -d ' ')
kill -INT -"$PG"
```

Confirm the ports actually released (`3000`, `8080`, `9091`) before starting
again; a stale listener produces confusing failures on the next run.

### Screenshotting the UI

Headless Chrome is present and catches things reading the code does not.

```bash
CHROME="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
"$CHROME" --headless=new --disable-gpu --hide-scrollbars \
  --force-device-scale-factor=2 --window-size=1600,900 \
  --virtual-time-budget=6000 --screenshot=out.png http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

Then read `out.png` with the Read tool. Defects found this way that tests and
type-checking both passed over: severity colours losing a CSS specificity fight
so remaining-days cells rendered in the ordinary text colour; a chip coloured
critical but labelled `ISSUED`; multi-line sentences set in an uppercase tracked
label style; a filter `<select>` bound to an absent key rendering blank.

Chrome cannot click. To photograph a panel that needs interaction, temporarily
patch the component to open it, screenshot, then **restore from a copy you saved
first** and grep to prove the harness is gone. Never commit one.

The system is in dark mode, and headless Chrome inherits it, so the light theme
cannot be photographed here. Say so rather than implying it was checked.

### Live-testing a gateway against a real CA

Vault is installed via `brew tap hashicorp/tap` (it is no longer in
homebrew-core). `scripts/lab-vault.sh` builds a root, a healthy intermediate, a
deliberately-expiring one, a `no_store` role and an AppRole; `--env` prints the
variables `gateways/vault/live_test.go` looks for. Those tests skip unless
`CERTPILOT_TEST_VAULT_ADDR`, `_ROLE_ID` and `_SECRET_ID` are set.

Facts about Vault that cost time to learn:

- `sys/health` is **not** wrapped in the `data` envelope. Decoding it through
  the envelope yields a zero value, which reads as "not initialized" for a Vault
  that is up and answering.
- Vault **refuses** to sign past its issuer's expiry rather than truncating.
  Every renewal through that mount fails at once.
- Serials are colon-separated hex from `big.Int.Bytes()`; Go's `Text(16)` drops
  leading zeros, so pad to even length before regrouping.
- On a `no_store` role, revoking **by serial** 400s and revoking **by
  certificate** succeeds. The two are different operations with different
  requirements.

---

## The store

Two implementations — `postgres.go` and `inmemory.go` — behind one interface,
kept honest by `conformance_test.go`. Point `CERTPILOT_TEST_DB_URL` at a
throwaway server to include PostgreSQL; the harness creates and drops databases
and refuses URLs containing `supabase.co`, `rds.amazonaws.com` or `neon.tech`.

### The four defect classes

Every one of these shipped at least once. Check for all four when touching the
store.

| | Class | How it shows up |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **A** | A Go constant a CHECK constraint refuses | Raw `SQLSTATE 23514` reaching the user, e.g. `environment: "lab"` |
| **B** | A model field a writer silently drops | The value round-trips in memory and vanishes against PostgreSQL |
| **C** | Empty string versus NULL | `coalesce` on read hides a writer that stored `''` where the code expects NULL |
| **D** | A parameter PostgreSQL types differently | `$1::jsonb` versus `$1`, and `COALESCE($1::text, col)` needing the cast |

**The in-memory store enforces no constraints**, so testing against it alone
finds none of these. It is also the reason `GetCAChain` was broken against every
real database from migration 006 until someone ran it.

When adding a column, touch all four places or the value is lost: the `SELECT`
column list, the scanner, the `INSERT`, and the `UPDATE`. A `COALESCE($n::type,
col)` in the `UPDATE` is usually right for anything a partial writer might not
carry — renewal builds a record from a gateway response and would otherwise wipe
operator-owned fields on every rotation.

### Migrations

Numbered, sequential, checksummed. `Migrate` reports `Applied`, `Skipped` and
`Drifted`; a drifted file is **not** re-run — reconcile it with a new migration.

Guard everything: `create table if not exists`, `add column if not exists`, and
a `do $$ … pg_constraint … $$` block for a CHECK, since PostgreSQL has no
`add constraint if not exists`.

Anything that must not run on Supabase does not belong in `migrations/`.

## Adding a gateway

The contract is `proto/provider/v1/provider.proto`, implemented by three
gateways already; `docs/writing-a-gateway.md` walks it end to end.

Points that matter:

- **`csr_pem` is part of the contract** and all three gateways honour it. When
  present, sign the key you were given rather than generating one.
- `GetCAInfo` feeds the CA inventory. Return the issuers behind the account and
  they become monitored, thresholded and alerted on like everything else.
- The core-to-gateway channel carries CSRs, private keys and CA credentials, so
  it is mutually authenticated by default. `make dev-certs` writes development
  material; `--insecure` is loopback-only and warns loudly.
- Each gateway is its own module. Add it to `go.work`, the `MODULES` list in the
  Makefile, and a Dockerfile.

A gateway holds **no credential of its own**. Each CA account carries the
identity it issues under, so the process is authorised to sign nothing.

## Certificate metadata

An admin defines the fields (`metadata_fields`), and certificates answer them in
a jsonb column with a GIN index. Four types: `TEXT`, `SELECT`, `MULTI_SELECT`,
`BOOLEAN`; a single choice draws as `DROPDOWN` or `RADIO`.

Invariants, each of which prevents a specific way of destroying data:

- **Keys and option values are immutable.** Labels are free to change; the value
  stored on a certificate never does. Otherwise a reworded option silently
  reclassifies history.
- **Fields archive, never delete.** A stored value with no definition is a value
  nothing can label.
- **A field's type is fixed after creation.** Changing it makes stored values
  unreadable rather than stale.
- **Required is enforced at issuance only.** Enforcing it on edits makes the
  whole estate unsaveable the moment somebody adds a field.
- **An unknown key is an error, not a silent drop.** A value under a misspelled
  key never appears on a form and never matches a filter.

`validateMetadata` in `core/api/metadata.go` holds all of this and has tests
covering each case.

## Frontend design system

`src/assets/styles/main.css` is the source of truth. Read its header comment
before changing anything visual.

### Tokens, never literals

```
--fs-micro | --fs-label | --fs-small | --fs-body   type scale
--ink-page/panel/rail/raised/hover                  surfaces
--line, --line-strong                               rules
--text-primary/secondary/muted                      text
--sev-critical/warning/ok/unknown                   severity, and only severity
--signal                                            interactive and alive
```

A hard-coded pixel size or hex colour in a component is a bug. The type scale
exists because the first cut shipped 9px labels that were unreadable on a real
screen at a normal distance.

### Components

- `ui/PanelBox.vue` — the only container. No cards, no shadows, no radius.
- `ui/SevChip.vue`, `ui/Readout.vue` — severity chip and large figure.
- `common/DataState.vue` — loading, error and first-load states. An error shows
  even when stale data is still on screen.
- `metadata/MetadataInput.vue` — all four field types in one component.
- `horizon/ExpiryHorizon.vue` — the logarithmic time axis.

### Classes with a reason

- `.field-help` for sentences, `.label-micro` for short headings. `label-micro`
  uppercases and tracks, which destroys word shape in anything with a verb.
- `.sev-*` are tripled for specificity. Leave them alone.
- `.substrate` is the faint ruled ground behind the horizon.
- `.surface-stale` and `.wall-alarm` are the degraded states. Both are meant to
  be uncomfortable.

### Converting a remaining view

Six views are still daisyUI. The pattern: keep the script logic, replace
`severityBadge`/`severityText`/`severityBorder` with `sevClass`/`sevBg`, swap
`card`/`btn`/`badge`/`table` for `PanelBox`/`.btn-console`/`SevChip`/`.tbl`, and
move explanatory text to `.field-help`. Screenshot before and after.

## Writing here

Comments explain **why**, and usually name the failure they prevent. This is the
strongest convention in the repo — a comment restating the code is worse than
none.

Commit messages are long. They state the problem, the reasoning, the failure
mode avoided, and what was verified live. `git log` has many examples.

When reporting work: say what was verified and how, and say plainly what was not.
"Fixed but unverified because no container runtime is available" is a better
sentence than one that implies a build happened.

# The host agent.
#
# Worth stating plainly, because the image invites the opposite assumption: an
# agent in a container inventories *that container's* filesystem. It is useful
# for enrolling a containerised workload or for exercising the agent protocol,
# and it is not a way to inventory the host it runs on unless the paths you care
# about are mounted into it.
#
# The agent generates its identity key inside its own state directory and sends
# no private key anywhere, so that directory must be a volume or enrolment is
# repeated on every restart.

## Three things worth knowing before you read anything else

**A dashboard that stops updating must look broken, not healthy.** A frozen
screen showing green manufactures false confidence, which is worse than no
screen. Connection state is a first-class element of the UI, the stream
heartbeats, and a dead feed visibly degrades the page.

**Renewal is not done when the certificate is stored.** It is done when the
thing in front of your users is serving it. That is why there is a verifier,
why deployment is a durable job, and why "deployed" and "being served" are
different words here.

**The strongest private key is the one CertPilot never sees.** The agent
generates keys on the host that will serve them and sends only a CSR. There is
no field the key could travel in.

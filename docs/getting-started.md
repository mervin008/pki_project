# Getting started

This walks through running CertPilot locally and issuing a certificate — first
from the self-signed gateway, then from a real ACME CA.

See the [README](../README.md) for what is and is not built. In short: the
core, the gateway architecture, ACME and Vault issuance, deployment, the host
agent, discovery and posture reporting all work end to end. There is no
revocation endpoint.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.26+
- Node.js 20+ (frontend only)
- PostgreSQL 13+ (`brew install postgresql@17`)
- [buf](https://buf.build) (only if you edit `.proto` files)

No cloud account is needed. If you skip PostgreSQL entirely the core still
starts, on an in-memory store seeded with sample data that is discarded on exit
— fine for a first look, useless for anything you want to still be there
tomorrow.

## The short version

```bash
make dev
```

That is the whole thing: it starts PostgreSQL if it is not already running,
creates a `certpilot_dev` database, applies the prelude and all 26 migrations,
generates a development key encryption key once and reuses it, starts the
self-signed gateway, the API, and the frontend, and registers the gateway as a
CA account so there is something to issue from.

Open `http://localhost:3000`. Ctrl-C stops everything, and stops PostgreSQL too
if it was not already running when you started.

The database survives restarts, and so does the key encryption key — it is
written to `.certpilot/dev-kek` and reused, because generating a fresh one would
make every private key already stored permanently unreadable.

To use a database of your own, export `CERTPILOT_DB_URL` before running; the
bootstrap above is skipped entirely, including the prelude, which must never run
against a real Supabase project.

The rest of this page is the same thing done by hand, which is what you want
when you are changing one piece of it.

## 1. Generate development keys

Two things need key material before anything starts.

```bash
make dev-certs
```

This writes mutual-TLS material into `.certpilot/pki/` — a throwaway CA, a
gateway certificate, and a core certificate. The core-to-gateway channel carries
certificate signing requests, private keys, and CA credentials, so it is
authenticated in both directions by default.

```bash
export CERTPILOT_KEK=$(make -s generate-kek | cut -d= -f2-)
```

The key encryption key seals certificate private keys and CA credentials before
they reach the database. Against a real database the core refuses to start
without one; with the in-memory store it will generate an ephemeral key and warn.
(`make dev` handles this for you and keeps the key in `.certpilot/dev-kek`.)

> `.certpilot/` is gitignored. Never commit it: it contains CA and ACME account
> private keys.

## 2. Configure

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.dev.yaml
```

The defaults are set up for local development: bound to loopback, anonymous API
access enabled, mTLS pointed at `.certpilot/pki/`. Production mode refuses all
three of those, so a development config cannot quietly become a production one.

## 3. Run

Each of these wants its own terminal.

```bash
make run-gateway-selfsigned   # :9091
```

```bash
make run-core                 # :8080
```

```bash
make run-frontend             # :3000
```

The dashboard is at `http://localhost:3000`. `/ca-health` lists every CA by
urgency, and `/display` is the fullscreen wall view — locally it works without a
credential, because the core accepts anonymous requests on loopback in
development mode. On a real deployment it needs a display token; see the README.

Confirm the gateway registered over mTLS:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8080/api/v1/gateways | jq '.data[] | {name, is_connected}'
```

## 4. Issue a certificate

Register the gateway as a CA account. The core connects, asks the gateway to
validate the configuration, and only then seals and stores it:

```bash
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/api/v1/ca-accounts \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
    "name": "selfsigned-dev",
    "provider_type": "selfsigned",
    "gateway_addr": "localhost:9091",
    "server_name": "localhost",
    "config": {"validity_days": 90}
  }' | jq
```

Then request a certificate, using the returned account id:

```bash
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/api/v1/certificates \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
    "common_name": "test.example.local",
    "sans": ["www.test.example.local"],
    "ca_account_id": "<id>",
    "key_type": "ECDSA",
    "key_size": 256,
    "auto_renew": true
  }' | jq
```

The response contains the certificate but **not** the private key. Keys are
never included in list or detail responses; exporting one is a separate
admin-only call that writes an audit record:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8080/api/v1/certificates/<id>/private-key | jq -r .private_key_pem
```

## 5. Issue from a real CA

Start the ACME gateway against Let's Encrypt staging:

```bash
make run-gateway-acme         # :9092
```

ACME needs to prove you control the domain. Pick a challenge:

### dns-01 (required for wildcards)

Cloudflare — the token needs Zone:Read and DNS:Edit:

```bash
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/api/v1/ca-accounts \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
    "name": "letsencrypt-staging",
    "provider_type": "acme",
    "gateway_addr": "localhost:9092",
    "server_name": "localhost",
    "config": {
      "directory_url": "letsencrypt-staging",
      "email": "you@example.com",
      "challenge": "dns-01",
      "dns_provider": "cloudflare",
      "dns_config": {"api_token": "YOUR_TOKEN"}
    }
  }' | jq
```

For any other DNS provider, use the webhook solver and write a small receiver —
see [dns-01 solvers](#dns-01-solvers) below.

### http-01

The CA fetches `http://<domain>/.well-known/acme-challenge/<token>` on port 80.
Either let the gateway bind port 80, or run it on a high port and have your
existing reverse proxy forward that path to it:

```json
{
  "directory_url": "letsencrypt-staging",
  "email": "you@example.com",
  "challenge": "http-01",
  "http01_bind_addr": "127.0.0.1:5002"
}
```

The gateway validates whichever configuration you supply before storing it, so a
wrong token or an unreachable directory is reported immediately rather than
during a renewal months later.

Move to production by changing `directory_url` to `letsencrypt`. Do that only
once staging works — Let's Encrypt production rate limits are strict and
recovering from hitting them takes a week.

## dns-01 solvers

| Provider | `dns_provider` | Required `dns_config` |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Cloudflare | `cloudflare` | `api_token` |
| Anything else | `webhook` | `url`, plus `bearer_token` and/or `signing_secret` |

The webhook solver exists so CertPilot does not have to implement a solver for
every DNS provider that will ever matter. It POSTs to an endpoint you control:

```json
{
  "action": "present",
  "type": "dns-01",
  "domain": "example.com",
  "fqdn": "_acme-challenge.example.com",
  "value": "the TXT record contents",
  "token": "acme-challenge-token"
}
```

`action` is `present` or `cleanup`. When `signing_secret` is set, the request
carries `X-CertPilot-Signature`: the hex HMAC-SHA256 of the raw body. Verify it
before touching a zone. Respond 2xx on success; a non-2xx body is surfaced to
the operator, so put the actual reason in it.

Your receiver must tolerate two `present` calls for the same FQDN with different
values — an order covering both `example.com` and `*.example.com` produces
exactly that, and both TXT records have to coexist.

## Using PostgreSQL

```bash
export CERTPILOT_DB_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/certpilot"
make run-core
```

Apply migrations in order from `migrations/`. Two caveats:

- `001_initial_schema.sql` references `auth.users` and `auth.jwt()`, which exist
  only on Supabase. It will not apply to vanilla PostgreSQL as written. The Go
  store layer is plain `pgx` and has no Supabase dependency; the schema is the
  only coupling.
- With a database configured, `CERTPILOT_KEK` is mandatory. Losing it makes
  every stored private key and CA credential unrecoverable, so put it in a
  secret manager, not a shell profile.

## Authentication

**Everything requires a sign-in, including local development.** On first start,
CertPilot creates the account named in `auth.bootstrap_admins`, generates a
password, and prints it once:

```
┌─ CertPilot: first run ──────────────────────────
│   email:    you@example.com
│   password: cbYF5-RMeJd-q446h-9DG9Y
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

`make dev` also writes it to `.certpilot/dev-admin`. There is no default
password and no anonymous mode.

For anything else, point `auth.jwks_url` at your identity provider — Keycloak,
Okta, Azure AD, Auth0, Authentik, or Supabase Auth all work. The core then
verifies asymmetrically signed tokens against published public keys and holds
nothing capable of minting one.

Roles are read from `app_metadata.certpilot_role` in the token, and only from
there — `user_metadata` is writable by the user it belongs to, so trusting it
would let any account promote itself.

| Role | Can do |
|:---|:---|
| `admin` | Everything, including deleting records and exporting private keys |
| `operator` | Issue, renew, and revoke certificates; manage CAs and policies |
| `auditor` | Read-only, including audit logs |
| `viewer` | Read-only |

## Troubleshooting

**`invalid TLS configuration`** — run `make dev-certs`, or pass `--insecure` to
a gateway for local work without TLS.

**`could not connect to the gateway`** — the gateway process is not running, or
its certificate does not name the host you dialed. Set `server_name` on the CA
account when connecting by IP or through a service alias.

**`CERTPILOT_KEK is not set`** — expected with a database configured. Run
`make generate-kek`.

**`the gateway rejected this configuration`** — the response lists exactly what
is wrong. This is the gateway's `ValidateConfig` doing its job before a bad
credential becomes a failed renewal.

**ACME `no usable challenge`** — the CA does not offer the challenge type you
configured. Wildcards require `dns-01`.

## Running against plain PostgreSQL

CertPilot's schema was written against Supabase, and migration 001 references
things a plain server does not have — `auth.users`, `auth.jwt()`, and a
`supabase_realtime` publication. Run the prelude once, then migrate:

```bash
psql "$CERTPILOT_DB_URL" -f deploy/plain-postgres/prelude.sql
certpilot-core --migrate
```

The prelude creates a stub `auth.jwt()` that returns no claims, so the
row-level security policies **fail closed**. That is deliberate: a stub cannot
verify a token, and returning a role would hand every connection whatever role
it named. CertPilot's own connection should own these tables — owners bypass RLS
— and authorisation for people is enforced in the API layer, which is where it
is enforced on Supabase too. What you do not get on a plain server is RLS as a
second line.

This path is exercised by `make test-store`, which migrates a throwaway database
from the repository's own migration files on every run.

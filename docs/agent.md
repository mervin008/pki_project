# The host agent

One binary that runs on the machines where certificates are actually served.

Its reason for existing is one sentence:

> **The agent generates its own private keys and never sends them anywhere.**
> CertPilot cannot produce them and does not claim to.

Everything else here follows from that.

## What it does

Four things, on a cycle:

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Heartbeat** | Reports that this host is alive, and what it holds |
| **Renew** | Replaces certificates it holds that are due, generating a new key each time |
| **Install** | Writes certificates where the local server reads them, and reloads it |
| **Inventory** | Reports the certificate files it finds on disk, including ones nobody told CertPilot about |

It is not a gateway. It speaks HTTPS to `/api/v1/agent/*`, not gRPC, and it is
authenticated by an Ed25519 signature rather than by a client certificate.

---

## Enrolment

```bash
certpilot-agent enrol \
  --server https://certpilot.internal:8080 \
  --token <enrolment token> \
  --name web-01
```

An operator issues the token first:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/api/v1/agent-enrol-tokens \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name": "web tier", "labels": {"tier": "web", "env": "production"}, "max_uses": 20}'
```

What happens, in order:

1. The agent **generates an Ed25519 keypair on the host**, before anything is
   sent.
2. It sends the public half, its hostname and its platform. There is no field
   in the request for the private half — not as a precaution but as the shape
   of the thing.
3. The core records the agent, attaches the token's **labels**, and returns an
   agent ID.
4. The agent writes its identity to `--state-dir` at `0600`.

Every subsequent request is signed:

```
certpilot-agent-v1
<METHOD>
<PATH>
<unix-seconds>
<hex sha256 of body>
```

Five-minute tolerance. Headers `X-CertPilot-Agent`, `X-CertPilot-Timestamp`,
`X-CertPilot-Signature`.

**Labels come from the token, not from the agent.** A host cannot label itself
into somebody else's grant — which is the whole point of putting the labels on
the token an operator issued.

**Re-enrolling is refused** when an identity already exists. Doing it silently
would leave the old agent's record on the core with a key nothing holds any
more, and nobody would notice until that host stopped renewing.

### State directory

| Running as | Default |
|:---|:---|
| root | `/var/lib/certpilot-agent` |
| anyone else | `$HOME/.certpilot-agent` |

Override with `--state-dir` or `CERTPILOT_AGENT_STATE`. Under `/var/lib` for a
system service because that is where a service's state belongs, and because it
does not then get backed up to somebody's home directory by accident.

---

## Grants

An agent cannot ask for whatever it likes. An operator writes a grant first,
and the grant is checked on every request.

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/api/v1/agent-grants -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "name": "web tier certificates",
  "label_selector": {"tier": "web"},
  "names": ["*.web.example.com", "api.example.com"],
  "ca_account_id": "<id>",
  "allowed_key_types": ["ECDSA"],
  "min_key_size": 256,
  "validity_days": 90,
  "renew_before_days": 30
}'
```

| Field | |
|:---|:---|
| `agent_id` | Targets one host |
| `label_selector` | Targets every agent carrying these labels. Either this or `agent_id` |
| `names` | Exact hostnames, or single-level wildcards |
| `ca_account_id` | **Part of the grant, not chosen by the agent.** An agent that could pick its own issuer could pick the cheapest, the least logged, or the one with the widest trust |
| `allowed_key_types`, `min_key_size` | What the host may generate |
| `validity_days` | How long the certificate is asked for |
| `renew_before_days` | Becomes `renew_after` in the response — **the core decides when**, not the host |

That last row matters more than it looks. A fleet that picked its own renewal
moment is a fleet that can decide to renew hourly, and four hundred hosts doing
that is a denial of service against your CA.

A refused request is recorded and raises `agent.request_refused`. An agent
asking for a name it has no grant for is a signal, not a nuisance.

---

## Requesting a certificate

```bash
certpilot-agent request --name web-01.example.com --key-type ECDSA
```

```
1. generate a key                       on this host
2. build a CSR                          names only — no extensions
3. POST /api/v1/agent/certificates      the CSR, and the install path
4. core checks the grant                names, key type, size, CA account
5. core asks the gateway to sign        the CSR travels; the key does not
6. write key (0600), cert, chain, meta  together, after the core answers
```

Step 6's ordering is deliberate: the key is written first at `0600`. If
anything fails after that, the host has a key it cannot use, which is inert.
The other order leaves a certificate whose key never landed — which looks like
a working deployment until something restarts.

The CSR carries **names only**. No basic constraints, no key usage, no
requested extensions: a CSR is a request, the CA builds its own template, and
anything else would at best be ignored and at worst honoured by a CA that
should not have.

### Renewal

The agent renews its own certificates, because it is the only thing that can —
rotating means generating a new key, and the core does not have one and must
not. The core's renewal sweep skips agent-held certificates for exactly that
reason.

When to renew comes from `renew_after` in the grant's response.

## Installing where the server reads

Getting a certificate is not the point. Putting it where nginx, HAProxy or
Postgres actually reads it, and reloading, is the point.

`/etc/certpilot/installs.json`:

```json
{
  "destinations": [
    {
      "name": "nginx",
      "certificate": "web-01.example.com",
      "cert_path": "/etc/nginx/tls/web-01.pem",
      "key_path": "/etc/nginx/tls/web-01-key.pem",
      "chain_path": "/etc/nginx/tls/chain.pem",
      "cert_mode": "0644",
      "key_mode": "0600",
      "owner": "root",
      "group": "root",
      "check": ["/usr/sbin/nginx", "-t"],
      "reload": ["/bin/systemctl", "reload", "nginx"]
    }
  ]
}
```

```bash
certpilot-agent install            # writes what has changed, checks, reloads
certpilot-agent install --force    # rewrite and reload even when unchanged
certpilot-agent install --offline  # do the local work, report nothing
```

The sequence per destination:

```
capture what is there  →  write atomically  →  run check  →  run reload
                                   │
                                   └── check fails → restore the previous bytes
```

**Atomic writes.** A temp file in the same directory, `chmod` before `rename`,
`Sync()` before `rename`. A server reading a half-written certificate is a
server that has stopped serving TLS.

**The check runs before the reload.** If `nginx -t` fails, the previous
contents come back and the reload never happens. A bad certificate that fails a
config check leaves the server exactly as it was.

**No shell.** `check` and `reload` are argv arrays executed directly, with a
bare `PATH=/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin`. There is no string to inject into.

**A combined file** — one path holding certificate and key, which HAProxy wants
— is refused if `cert_mode` would make it world-readable. The key is in that
file.

### Why `--offline` exists

Putting a certificate this machine already holds where its own server reads it
needs permission from nobody. `--offline` works with a revoked credential or an
unreachable core, because the alternative — a host that cannot fix its own TLS
because the control plane is down — is the wrong dependency to create.

---

## Inventory

```bash
certpilot-agent scan --json
```

Walks the default paths (or `--path`, repeatable), parses every certificate it
finds, and reports fingerprint, subject, expiry and **whether a private key sits
beside it and how readable that key is**.

The last part is the interesting one. `agent.key_exposed` fires when a private
key on a host is group- or world-readable. That is a finding no amount of
certificate management produces, and it is usually somebody's `cp` from three
years ago.

Reported certificates the core does not recognise raise `agent.unmanaged` —
the same verdict as a network scan, from the inside.

---

## Running it

```bash
certpilot-agent run                # the loop: heartbeat, renew, install, inventory
certpilot-agent run --once         # one cycle, then exit — for cron or a unit timer
certpilot-agent status             # what this host holds and when it last reported
```

As a systemd unit:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=CertPilot agent
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/certpilot-agent run
Restart=always
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

It runs as root when it has to write into `/etc/nginx` and reload a service.
Where it does not, run it as a user that owns the certificate directory.

## What can go wrong

| Symptom | Cause |
|:---|:---|
| `enrol` refuses | An identity already exists in the state directory. Remove it deliberately, or use another `--state-dir` |
| Requests rejected with a signature error | Clock skew beyond five minutes. Check NTP |
| `agent.request_refused` in the activity feed | The host asked for a name no grant covers. Check `label_selector` and `names` |
| A certificate renews but the server serves the old one | The install destination is not where the server actually reads. `certpilot-agent install --force` and read the check output |
| `agent.stale` | The host stopped reporting. Its certificates will expire silently — this alert is the only warning |
| `agent.key_exposed` | A private key on that host is group- or world-readable |

# Running CertPilot against a database

The core keeps everything in memory when no connection string is configured.
That is fine for a first look and useless for anything else: the seeded CAs and
certificates are demonstration data, and every restart discards whatever you
did. Once you want the dashboard to mean something, point it at PostgreSQL.

CertPilot stores everything in a PostgreSQL database **you run**. It does not
provision, manage or migrate a server on your behalf, and it has no hosted mode:
you give it a connection string and it uses it. Anything speaking PostgreSQL 14
or later works — a local server, a container, a managed instance, whatever your
organisation already operates.

The Go store layer is `pgx` talking to `public.*`, and the schema needs nothing
a stock server does not have: no extensions, no platform-specific roles, no
prelude. `TestNoMigrationDependsOnSupabase` fails the build if that stops being
true.

---

## 1. Get a connection string

Whatever your server hands you, with a database CertPilot owns:

```
postgres://certpilot:<password>@<host>:5432/certpilot?sslmode=require
```

Add `sslmode=require` unless the server is on the same host. Saying so means a
misconfiguration fails instead of quietly downgrading to plaintext.

**Connect as the role that owns the tables.** CertPilot creates and reads its
own schema, and a role without ownership hits permission errors on migration
rather than at a convenient moment.

### If you put a pooler in front of it

Use **session mode**, not transaction mode. `pgx` uses the extended query
protocol and caches prepared statements per connection; a transaction-mode
pooler hands your next query to a different backend, where that statement was
never prepared. If you must use transaction mode, disable the cache explicitly:

```
postgres://…/certpilot?sslmode=require&default_query_exec_mode=exec&statement_cache_capacity=0
```

---

## 2. Set the key encryption key

```bash
export CERTPILOT_KEK=$(make -s generate-kek | cut -d= -f2-)
```

Certificate private keys and CA credentials are sealed with this before they
reach the database, so the core refuses to start against a database without one.
Put it in a secret manager. **Losing it makes every stored secret unrecoverable**
— the rows survive and nothing can read them.

---

## 3. Apply the schema

```bash
export CERTPILOT_DB_URL='postgres://postgres.<ref>:<password>@<host>:5432/postgres?sslmode=require'
make migrate
```

```

```

Applied files are recorded in `public.schema_migrations` with a checksum, so
rerunning is a no-op and editing a migration that has already run is reported
rather than silently ignored or silently rerun. Concurrent runs serialise on a
Postgres advisory lock.

The server never migrates on startup. A schema change should be something an
operator decides to do, not a side effect of one replica restarting mid-deploy
while the others still read the old shape. Run it as a job, an init container, or
by hand.

If you would rather apply the SQL by hand with `psql`, apply the files
in numeric order. `004`, `006`, `007`, `008`, and `012` add columns to or alter
constraints on tables `001` creates.

### Migration 005 is not optional

`001` used to declare every actor column as `references auth.users(id)` —
`certificates.created_by`, `audit_logs.actor_id`, and five more — against an
identity table CertPilot does not own. The core verifies OIDC tokens against
whatever `auth.jwks_url` points at, as likely to be Keycloak or Okta, and stores
that provider's `sub`. Those subjects were never rows in that table.

`001` no longer creates those constraints, so on a database built today `005` is
a no-op by construction. It matters on a database built by an older CertPilot,
where the constraints exist and still need dropping.

The result is not a cosmetic inconsistency. Issuing a certificate raises a
foreign key violation and fails. Local development hits it on the first request,
because anonymous access writes a fixed subject that deliberately is not a real
user.

`005` drops those constraints and keeps the columns. Migration `003` had already
taken this position for `display_tokens`; `005` applies it to the tables that
predate it.

---

## 4. Start the core

```bash
make run-core          # picks up CERTPILOT_DB_URL
```

or `--db=postgres://…`. Resolution order is `--db`, then `CERTPILOT_DB_URL`, then
`DATABASE_URL`.

You should see:

```
INFO connected to PostgreSQL
```

The dashboard will show zeros, because the database is empty and the sample data
lived only in memory. That is the correct output, and being able to trust it is
the point.

---

## Row-level security

**CertPilot's schema does not use it.** Authorisation for people is enforced in
the API layer, which is where it was always enforced — the tables carry no
policies and no `enable row level security`.

Earlier versions did, with policies written against a hosted platform's JWT
function and its `authenticated` role. On a server without those objects the
policies could not be created at all, and where they could, they protected a
path CertPilot does not use.

The startup check in `store.Preflight` stays, because an operator can still
enable RLS on these tables by hand, and the failure mode is the worst available:

> **A policy that denies a `SELECT` does not raise an error. It returns zero
> rows.**

A core connected as a role that RLS applied to would start cleanly, answer every
request, and report an estate with no certificates, no CAs and nothing expiring
— which on a wall display is indistinguishable from an organisation whose PKI is
in perfect health. That is precisely the failure this product exists to prevent,
arriving through its own database connection. So the core refuses to start
rather than serve a reassuring lie:

```
failed to connect to the database: row-level security would silently hide rows
in ca_authorities, certificates from this connection, so the dashboard would
show an empty, healthy-looking estate. Connect as the role that owns these
tables, or grant the current role BYPASSRLS
```

The same check refuses an unmigrated or half-migrated database, for the same
reason — an empty dashboard is a plausible-looking dashboard.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
|:---|:---|
| `network is unreachable` | Direct connection on an IPv4-only network. Use the session pooler. |
| `prepared statement "stmtcache_…" already exists` / `does not exist` | Transaction pooler without `default_query_exec_mode=exec`. |
| `the database has none of CertPilot's tables` | Run `make migrate`. |
| `row-level security would silently hide rows…` | Connected as a non-owner role. See above. |
| `insert or update on table … violates foreign key constraint` naming `auth.users` | Migration `005` has not been applied. |
| `CERTPILOT_KEK is required` | See step 2. |
| Dashboard shows zeros | Expected on a fresh database. Preflight has already ruled out the two ways this could be a lie. |

---

## What running this for the first time found

Everything above was verified against a live PostgreSQL 17 server (
session pooler, `eu-north-1`): all five migrations applied and reapplied
idempotently, three CAs registered, a certificate issued through the self-signed
gateway, renewed with key rotation, its private key exported and checked against
the certificate, six health sweeps run, and a kiosk display token exercised on
every route it is allowed and refused.

Four defects surfaced that the in-memory store could not express, which is worth
recording because it is the argument for a container-backed test suite:

1. **Issuance failed outright.** `certificates.environment` is nullable with a
   `CHECK` constraint. The Go field is a plain `string`, so a request that did
   not name an environment wrote `''` — and a CHECK passes on NULL but fails on
   `''`. Every certificate request without an explicit environment was rejected
   by the database.
2. **The CA expiry window never worked.** `not_after <= now() + ($1 || ' days')`
   leaves both sides of `||` untyped, so PostgreSQL resolved it as `text || text`
   and reported the parameter as text while the driver held an int. Now
   `make_interval(days => $1)`.
3. **Empty lists serialized as `null`, not `[]`** — pgx leaves a slice nil when a
   query returns no rows. The dashboard calls `.map()` on that, so an empty
   estate would have rendered as a crash rather than as zeros.
4. **A single NULL could take out an entire list endpoint.** Several nullable
   columns scan into non-pointer Go fields, and pgx fails the whole query rather
   than the row. One hand-inserted or bulk-imported certificate with a null
   `key_size` would have blanked the certificate list. Both read projections now
   `COALESCE`.

Migration 001 also had to be made rerunnable: `create policy` has no
`if not exists`, so applying the file to a database that already had the schema
failed on the first policy and rolled back everything.

### Migration 012 exists because a check constraint outlived its list

`001` constrained `certificates.discovered_via` to `MANUAL`, `SCAN`, `CT_LOG`,
`IMPORT`, and `REQUESTED`. Adopting a certificate found in a cloud store is none
of those, and the insert was rejected outright.

It is worth recording alongside the four defects below, because it is the same
lesson arriving from a different direction: **the in-memory store enforces no
check constraints**, so every automated test of the import path passed. It was
found by importing a certificate against the real database.

The tempting fix was to write `IMPORT` and move on. `discovered_via` exists to
answer one question — which of these did we issue, and which did we merely find?
— and answering it with the same word for a PEM somebody pasted and a
certificate discovered sitting in a production Key Vault throws away the more
interesting half.

Migrations are append-only for the same reason the migrator checksums them: an
edit to `001` would have left this database recording a file it no longer
matches. Editing an applied migration prints a warning on every subsequent run,
which is the migrator working correctly and worth not silencing.

### Migration 013 replaces leader election with two constraints

`renewal_jobs` is the one table in this schema that exists to make concurrency
safe rather than to record something. Two things in it do that work, and both
are cheaper and more robust than the advisory-lock leader the roadmap originally
called for:

```sql
create unique index idx_renewal_jobs_one_outstanding
  on public.renewal_jobs (certificate_id)
  where status in ('PENDING', 'RUNNING');
```

At most one outstanding job per certificate. Every replica can run the renewal
sweep; the second one to enqueue a given certificate loses the race on this
index and its insert is discarded by `ON CONFLICT … DO NOTHING`.

```sql
SELECT id FROM public.renewal_jobs
WHERE (status = 'PENDING' AND run_after <= $3)
   OR (status = 'RUNNING' AND locked_until < $3)
ORDER BY not_after ASC NULLS LAST, run_after ASC
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
LIMIT 1
```

`SKIP LOCKED` means two workers claiming at the same instant never collide —
the second takes the next row rather than blocking or duplicating. The second
`OR` arm is the lease: a worker that was killed releases its job when
`locked_until` passes, with nothing needing to notice it died.

A leader would have given one replica all the work and a failover window during
which no certificate renews at all. These two lines give N equal workers and no
window.

## The conformance suite

Ten defects reached a live database that the test suite could not express. They
were not ten unrelated mistakes. They were instances of four classes:

| | Class | Instances |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **A** | A Go constant the database's CHECK constraint refuses | migrations 012, 021, 022, 024 |
| **B** | A model field a writer does not persist | migration 016; later the in-memory store dropping `deploy_on_renewal` |
| **C** | An empty Go string in a column whose CHECK passes on NULL | `certificates.environment`, the first live run |
| **D** | A bound parameter PostgreSQL types differently from the driver | the CA expiry window; migration 018's interval |

Testing the in-memory store alone finds none of them: it has no constraints, no
column lists, no NULL, and no type inference. Testing PostgreSQL alone finds A,
C and D but not B in the direction that actually bit — the in-memory store
silently dropping a field the database persists correctly.

So the shape is **one suite, both implementations**, in `core/store/conformance_test.go`:

```
docker compose -f deploy/plain-postgres/docker-compose.yml up -d
make test-store
```

The most valuable test in it is `TestEveryValueThisCodebaseCanProduceIsAccepted`,
and it is valuable because of what it does *not* do. It does not check that
`'AGENT'` works — that is the shape of test written after a defect, and it
passes for ever while the next value fails identically. It asserts the invariant
those four migrations violated: **a value the Go code can write must be a value
the schema accepts.** A constant added without widening its constraint now fails
on a laptop instead of in production.

Two classes are PostgreSQL-only, in `postgres_only_test.go`, because the
in-memory store cannot exhibit them even in principle: queries with bound
intervals actually run, and a row full of NULLs does not blank a whole list.

Each test database is created, migrated **from the repository's own migration
files by the migrator that ships**, and dropped. That is not a detail — a
hand-maintained `schema_test.sql` would drift from `migrations/`, and the suite
would go on passing while the two diverged, which is the exact failure this
exercise exists to end.

### What the suite has found

Eight things, none of which any existing test could have caught. Three came on
its first run and the rest arrived later, which is the more useful lesson — the
suite earns its keep on every schema change, not once.

**The schema did not apply to plain PostgreSQL at all.** Migration 001
referenced `auth.users`, `auth.jwt()` and a hosted platform's publication. This
had been a known gap since week one and nothing had ever tried it. It was first
worked around with a prelude of stub objects, and then removed properly: the
migrations carry no platform coupling, all of them apply to a stock server, and
`TestNoMigrationDependsOnSupabase` fails the build if any returns.

**`PostgresStore.CreateAgent` refused an agent the in-memory store accepted.**
`agents.heartbeat_interval_seconds` carries `DEFAULT 300` and a CHECK that it is
positive — but passing an explicit zero overrides the default and violates the
check. The in-memory store applied a floor; PostgreSQL did not. Class B, in the
direction where the database writer is the one missing something.

**`CreateCertificate` silently dropped every revocation column.** Found on the
first run *after* migration 030 added them, and worth recording because the
suite caught it in both directions at once. The writer never named `revoked_at`,
`revocation_reason` or `revoked_by`, so importing a certificate that is already
revoked set `status = 'REVOKED'`, dropped the timestamp, and had the whole
insert refused by 030's consistency CHECK. Class B — a model field a writer
drops — presenting as class A: a value the Go code produces that the schema
rejects. The in-memory store has no CHECK to violate, so it accepted the
inconsistent pair and agreed with itself for as long as the suite ran without a
database. `make test` was green throughout.

**Four more, the day `discovery_test.go` and `cloud_test.go` started running
against PostgreSQL at all.** Both had always called `NewMemoryStore()` directly
rather than going through `forEachStore`, so every assertion in them had only
ever been made against the implementation with no CHECK constraints, no foreign
keys and no uuid columns. `preflight_test.go` now fails if another one is
written.

- `UpsertCloudCertificates` and `CreateDiscoveryResults` passed an explicit
  empty `management_state`, which **overrides** `default 'UNMANAGED'` rather
  than falling back to it — so the CHECK refused the row. The same trap as
  `agents.heartbeat_interval_seconds` above, in three more tables.
- `cloud_connections.name` was unique case-**sensitively** in PostgreSQL and
  case-insensitively in memory, so "prod-eu" and "PROD-EU" were one connection
  in the tests and two in production, both syncing the same account.
- **An adopted cloud certificate reverted to unmanaged on the next sync.** The
  upsert wrote `management_state = excluded.management_state`, and the provider
  goes on reporting the certificate as unmanaged because it has no idea it was
  adopted. The in-memory store had always preserved it, which is exactly why
  nothing noticed. A test named `TestImportSurvivesTheNextSync` had been
  asserting the opposite of what production did.
- `GetActiveAcknowledgement` returned a half-scanned struct **alongside** its
  error, so a caller checking only the pointer would read a database failure as
  somebody having acknowledged the alert.

**Migration 002 was never rerunnable.** PostgreSQL has no
`add constraint if not exists`, so re-applying the file failed on
`certificates_key_type_fkey` and rolled the whole thing back — breaking a rule
migration 001 states in its own comments, on the day it was written. The
migrator records what it has applied and never re-applies, so nothing noticed;
what this protects is somebody running the SQL by hand against a database that
already has the schema, which is precisely the case migration 001's note was
about.

> **Note on the checksum.** Fixing migration 002 changes its checksum, so the
> migrator will report it as *drifted* once on an existing database. That is the
> warning working, not a problem: the file is recorded as applied and will not
> be re-applied. It is mentioned here because a warning nobody explained is a
> warning somebody eventually silences.

### Migration 025 and a schema that waited twenty-three migrations

Migration 002 was written in the first week of this project. It removed the
hardcoded algorithm allow-lists, added `signature_algorithm`,
`quantum_readiness_score` and `endpoint_tls_posture`, and created a
`certificate_crypto_posture` view. Nothing wrote to any of it until migration
025.

That is worth recording rather than quietly fixing, because the schema was
right and the wait was correct. Columns are cheap and cost nothing while empty;
the assessment logic that fills them would have been guesswork in week one, and
the most important column in the whole feature is one migration 002 did not
think of.

That column is `offered_hybrid`. "This endpoint did not negotiate a post-quantum
key exchange" is a finding about the server only if CertPilot offered one; if it
did not, the identical row is a finding about CertPilot. Go enables
X25519MLKEM768 by default today and that default can change in a release, so
what was offered is recorded per observation rather than inferred from the code
that made it.

Migration 025 also puts a comment on migration 002's `certificates_key_type_fkey`,
which was created NOT VALID with a note to validate it "when convenient". It is
now deliberately never validated: a certificate discovered on somebody's
appliance carrying an algorithm the reference table has never heard of must
still be recordable, because the whole point of finding it is that nobody knew
it was there. A stale TODO in a file nobody reopens is now a decision written
where the constraint is.

### Migration 024, two spellings of one provider, and a fourth widening

`deployment_targets.target_type` needed `'f5'` and `'azure_key_vault'`. The
first is new. The second is the interesting one.

Migration 001 spelled that provider `azure_kv` in this constraint. Migration 011
spelled it `azure_key_vault` in `cloud_connections.provider`. Both have been
sitting there ever since and nothing noticed, because until now nothing ever
compared them — a cloud connection was for reading and a deployment target was
for writing, and the two never met.

Step 2 made them meet. A cloud deployment target borrows the credentials of a
cloud connection rather than storing a second copy, and the check that the
connection is the right kind of account compares those two strings directly. Two
spellings of one provider had been a latent bug in the schema since migration
001, waiting for the first join.

`azure_kv` is left in the permitted list rather than removed. It is unused, and
dropping a value from a check constraint is how a migration fails on somebody
else's data at three in the morning.

This is also the fourth widening of a constraint that enumerates kinds of thing,
one migration after 022 predicted there would be more.

### Migration 023 and a default that does not apply to existing rows

`certificate_deployments.deploy_on_renewal` defaults to `true`, and the same
migration sets every row that already existed to `false`. Those two statements
look like a mistake and are the point of the migration.

A binding created from here on is created by somebody who knows that renewals
now install by themselves. A binding that already existed was created under a
regime where nothing deployed without a person pressing something, and turning
it on at upgrade time would mean a package manager deciding to write to
production servers. `ADD COLUMN ... DEFAULT true` backfills, so the `UPDATE`
undoing it for existing rows is deliberate and is guarded on the migration not
having been recorded as applied before — migrations here are append-only and
checksummed, but "this ran twice" happens to people, and the cost of being
wrong is an estate that quietly stops deploying.

There is no `deploy_order` column, and its absence is also a decision. Waves
were designed and dropped in favour of a rule that needs no configuration: the
queue will not start a job for a certificate while another job for that
certificate has failed. That lives entirely in the claim predicate, and the one
index this migration adds is what makes it cheap.

### Migration 022 and the third widening of a closed list

`deployment_targets.target_type` refused `'agent'`, for exactly the reason
`certificates.discovered_via` refused `'CLOUD'` and then `'AGENT'`: a check
constraint listing values is a decision that the set is closed, and every one of
these widenings has been a case where it was not.

Three times is a pattern rather than a coincidence, so it is written down here
rather than patched quietly each time. The rule that falls out of it: **a check
constraint that enumerates a domain of "kinds of thing" will need widening; one
that enumerates a lifecycle (`PENDING`, `RUNNING`, `SUCCEEDED`) will not.** The
first is an inventory of the world, which grows. The second is a state machine,
which is designed.

Migration 022 also carries the first table in this schema deliberately shaped by
what it must *not* be able to hold. `agent_installations` has `reload_command`
and `check_command` columns, and there is no path anywhere in the Go layer by
which the core can write them: they arrive from the host, for display. A column
the core could set would make this table a queue for arbitrary code on every
machine in the estate, authenticated by whoever can write one row.

### Migration 021, and a constraint that has now been the last to notice twice

`certificates_discovered_via_check` refused `'AGENT'`. Migration 012 widened the
same constraint for `'CLOUD'`, in the same circumstances, found the same way.

Worth naming rather than repeating quietly: **this constraint needs widening
every time a certificate can arrive from somewhere new**, and both times the
temptation was to reuse an existing value instead. `'IMPORT'` would have passed
and thrown away the answer to the only question the column exists for — a
certificate whose key was generated on the host that serves it and has never
been anywhere else is not the same thing as one somebody pasted into a form, and
the difference is the entire point of the agent.

Both times it was found by running rather than testing, because the in-memory
store enforces no constraints. That is now six defects of this shape, and the
list stopped being a coincidence — see
[the conformance suite](#the-conformance-suite) for what was done about it:

| Migration | What only PostgreSQL knew |
|:---|:---|
| 012 | `discovered_via` refused `'CLOUD'` |
| 016 | `UpdateCertificate`'s explicit column list silently dropped new writes |
| 018 | An untyped `$1` in `$1 - <interval>` was inferred as an interval |
| 021 | `discovered_via` refused `'AGENT'` |
| 022 | `deployment_targets.target_type` refused `'agent'` |
| 024 | The same constraint refused `'f5'`, and spelled Key Vault differently from `cloud_connections` |

(The remaining one was a deployment binding summary that read as an all-clear over a
failing target — not a constraint, but the same root: the in-memory store cannot
express what the database enforces, so the tests could not fail.) A
container-backed suite remains the fix and remains unwritten.

### Migration 018 and a parameter PostgreSQL typed as an interval

The agent staleness predicate is one expression used by two queries — the fleet
list and the alert sweep — written once so a dashboard cannot disagree with the
message that woke somebody up. The list interpolates `now()`; the sweep binds
the instant as `$1`.

The version with `now()` worked. The version with `$1` failed at runtime:

```
ERROR: operator does not exist: timestamp with time zone < interval (SQLSTATE 42883)
```

PostgreSQL infers a bound parameter's type from its context, and the only
context here was `$1 - <interval>` — which resolves perfectly happily as
interval arithmetic. The parameter came out as an `interval`, the whole
right-hand side became an `interval`, and the comparison had nothing to do with
timestamps at all. Fixed with an explicit `(…)::timestamptz` and by switching to
`make_interval(secs => …)`, which removes the precedence question entirely.

Every test passed throughout: the in-memory store computes staleness in Go.
That is the fourth defect in this project that only a real database run has
found, after migration 012's check constraint, migration 016's dropped column
list, and the deployment binding summary. The pattern is consistent enough to be
a rule — **the in-memory store cannot express what the database enforces**, and
a container-backed suite remains the fix.

### Migration 017 and an index that had to differ from the one above it

`deployment_jobs` is `renewal_jobs` with one line changed, and that line is the
whole design.

Renewal's partial unique index is on `certificate_id`: at most one outstanding
renewal per certificate, because a second one issues a second certificate
against a weekly quota. Deployment is the opposite case. A wildcard bound to six
load balancers needs six jobs outstanding at once, so the index is on
`deployment_id` — the *binding*, the place — and copying the renewal queue
verbatim would have produced a system that deployed to whichever target got
there first and discarded the other five without an error, a log line, or a row.

The same reasoning is why `certificate_deployments` exists at all rather than
three more columns on `certificates`. Migration 001 modelled deployment as
`certificates.deployment_target_id`: one certificate, one place. Six places have
six outcomes and six fingerprints, and a single `deployed_at` averages them into
a value that is true of nowhere. That column survives — nothing in the
deployment path reads it — and is listed in the roadmap's known gaps for
removal.

### Migration 016 and a column list that quietly dropped writes

`UpdateCertificate` writes an explicit column list. Adding `previous_fingerprint`
and the verification columns to the Go model without adding them to that list
meant the renewal set them, the update ran, and the values never reached the
database — no error, no warning.

Every test passed. The in-memory store keeps whole structs, so it cannot express
a dropped column at all; this is the same lesson as migration 012's check
constraint, arriving from the other direction. Found by renewing a real
certificate and watching `previous_fingerprint` come back empty.

The fix was not to widen `UpdateCertificate`. Verification state is written
through its own narrow writer, because the verifier runs concurrently with
everything else and a whole-row write from a stale copy would undo a renewal
that completed while it was probing. `previous_fingerprint` is coalesced there
rather than overwritten: it is set once by the renewal that scheduled the check
and every later pass has to keep it.

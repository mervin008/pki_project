# Security

CertPilot manages certificate private keys and certificate authority
credentials. A weakness here is a weakness in whatever it protects, so this
document states the security model plainly, including what is not yet done.

**CertPilot is in early development and has not been audited. Do not run it in
production.**

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue. Email **security@certpilot.dev** with a description,
reproduction steps, and affected versions. Expect acknowledgement within three
working days.

We will not pursue legal action against good-faith research that respects user
privacy, avoids service disruption, and gives us reasonable time to fix the
issue before disclosure.

## Model

### Private keys

The best outcome is that CertPilot never holds one.

Supply a CSR with a certificate request and the key stays wherever it was
generated. When no CSR is supplied the gateway generates a key, and that key is
sealed with AES-256-GCM before it reaches the database. This is the intended
architecture for the host agent (roadmap phase 5): keys generated on the machine
that will serve them, never traversing the network.

Stored keys are excluded from every list and detail response. Exporting one is a
separate admin-only endpoint that writes an audit record with the actor and
client IP.

### Encryption at rest

Set `CERTPILOT_KEK` to a base64-encoded 32-byte key (`make generate-kek`). The
core refuses to start against a database without one.

Each value is sealed under a freshly generated 256-bit data encryption key,
which is itself wrapped by the KEK. Only the KEK needs external custody. Rotation
is incremental — set the new key as `CERTPILOT_KEK`, list the old one in
`CERTPILOT_KEK_RETIRED`, and re-seal at leisure. No flag-day migration.

Ciphertexts are bound to the field they belong to via AES-GCM additional
authenticated data, so a blob sealed as `ca_account:config` will not decrypt as
`certificate:private_key`. A database-level mixup or a deliberate field swap
fails closed.

**Losing the KEK makes every stored private key and CA credential
unrecoverable.** Put it in a secret manager, not a shell profile or a config
file.

### Transport

Core-to-gateway is mutual TLS 1.3. Both ends present a certificate and verify
the peer against a shared CA; the gateway requires a client certificate. That
channel carries certificate signing requests, private keys, and CA credentials,
so an unauthenticated peer must never reach it.

gRPC reflection is off by default — it makes a gateway trivially enumerable.

TLS can be disabled for local development, but it must be asked for explicitly,
it warns on every start, and production mode refuses it.

### Authentication

Prefer `auth.jwks_url`. The core then verifies asymmetrically signed tokens
against the provider's published public keys and holds nothing capable of
minting one. The legacy `auth.jwt_secret` path requires the core to hold a
symmetric key that can forge admin tokens.

- Accepted signing algorithms are pinned, which blocks `alg: none` and
  algorithm-confusion attacks
- Expiry is required; a token without one is rejected
- Issuer and audience are validated when configured
- An invalid token is **always** rejected. There is no mode in which a bad token
  falls back to a privileged identity

`auth.allow_anonymous` treats requests with no `Authorization` header as admin.
It is refused unless the server is in development mode bound to a loopback
address. A malformed token is still a 401 even when it is enabled.

### Display tokens

A dashboard on a wall has nobody to sign in at it. The obvious workaround —
leaving an operator session logged in on that machine — gives an unattended
screen in a corridor the authority to issue certificates, revoke them, and
export private keys. A display token is a separate credential that carries none
of that.

The constraints are enforced in one middleware rather than per route, because a
rule that has to be remembered at every call site is one that will eventually be
forgotten at one:

- **The role is the constant `viewer`.** Not configurable, not derived from any
  input, and not raisable by anything the request contains
- **`GET` only.** Any other method is refused on every route, before the route's
  own gate is consulted
- **Refused by path** regardless of role: `/certificates/:id/private-key`,
  `/display-tokens` (so one leaked screen cannot enumerate the others), and
  `/dashboard/activity` (audit entries name who did what, which does not belong
  on a screen in a corridor)
- **An invalid token aborts**, and never falls through to the next
  authenticator. With `allow_anonymous` enabled for local evaluation, falling
  through would hand a rejected token an admin identity
- **A real session always wins.** A request carrying an `Authorization` header is
  never resolved as a display token, so one left in a bookmark cannot mask an
  operator's identity in the audit log

256 bits of CSPRNG output behind a `cpd_` prefix, so secret scanners can match
it. Only a SHA-256 is stored: the raw value exists in the creation response and
nowhere else, and is compared in constant time. Tokens carry an expiry, are
revocable, and record `last_seen_at` and `last_seen_ip` so a leaked one is
visible in use. Creation and revocation are admin-only and audited.

Presented as an `X-Display-Token` header, or a `display_token` query parameter
for clients that cannot set headers. The header is preferred and is what the
CertPilot frontend uses; `RequestLogger` redacts the query parameter, but a
query string still reaches proxy logs and browser history in ways a header does
not.

### Authorization

Roles come from `app_metadata.certpilot_role` in the token, and only from there.
`user_metadata` is writable by the user it belongs to, so trusting it would let
any account promote itself to admin.

| Role | Scope |
|:---|:---|
| `admin` | Everything, including deletion and private key export |
| `operator` | Issue, renew, revoke; manage CAs and policies |
| `auditor` | Read-only, including audit logs |
| `viewer` | Read-only |

Unrecognised roles fall back to `viewer`.

### Fail closed

Where a security control cannot be evaluated, the operation is refused:

- A policy engine that cannot be reached blocks issuance, rather than treating a
  database blip as "no violations"
- A gateway returning data that is not a valid X.509 certificate produces an
  error rather than a record marked `ISSUED`
- A private key that cannot be encrypted is not stored in the clear
- A failed database connection is fatal when a database was configured, rather
  than silently falling back to an in-memory store

### Production mode

`server.mode: production` refuses configurations that are convenient locally and
dangerous deployed — anonymous access, an insecure gateway channel, and wildcard
CORS origins. These are the settings that look harmless in a development config
and travel unnoticed.

### HTTP

`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`,
`Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, and `Cache-Control: no-store` on every response.

CORS reflects the request origin only when it appears in
`server.allowed_origins`. A wildcard is never sent: it is invalid alongside
credentials and browsers reject the combination.

## Known gaps

Stated here rather than discovered later.

| Gap | Impact |
|:---|:---|
| Audit log is not tamper-evident | An ordinary table; anything with database write access can rewrite history. Hash-chaining is roadmap phase 3 |
| No distributed locking on renewal | Two core replicas will renew the same certificate concurrently |
| No retry or backoff on renewal | A transient CA failure means the renewal is missed until the next scan |
| OCSP check is not a real OCSP request | A plain GET, so a responder returning 400 is scored healthy. RFC 6960 requires a POST with a DER-encoded request |
| Policy evaluated on issuance only | Renewals bypass policy entirely |
| Several policy rule types unimplemented | `key_type`, `naming`, and `approval_required` are accepted by the schema and silently do nothing |
| No rate limiting on the HTTP API | No protection against brute force or resource exhaustion. Display tokens are not throttled either — guessing 256 bits is not the concern, but a stolen token being used heavily is, and only revocation stops it |
| Client IPs are not verified | Trusted proxies are unconfigured, so `X-Forwarded-For` is taken from whoever sends it. Audit entries and display-token `last_seen_ip` are hints, not evidence |
| ACME account keys stored unencrypted on disk | Mode 0600 in the gateway state directory, not sealed with the KEK |
| No secret zeroization guarantees | Go's garbage collector may retain copies of plaintext keys in memory |

## Hardening a deployment

1. Set `server.mode: production` — it enforces much of the below
2. Store `CERTPILOT_KEK` in a secret manager; never in the config file
3. Use `auth.jwks_url`, not `auth.jwt_secret`
4. Issue real mTLS certificates for the gateway channel; `make dev-certs` is for
   development, and it writes the CA key beside the certificates it signs
5. Restrict `server.allowed_origins` to the frontend origin
6. Run gateways on a network segment reachable only by the core
7. Supply your own CSRs so private keys never reach CertPilot
8. Grant `admin` sparingly — it is the only role that can export private keys
9. Ship audit logs to external storage, since the table is not yet tamper-evident
10. Run the core behind a reverse proxy that terminates TLS and rate-limits
11. Give each wall display its own display token with a real expiry, and revoke
    it when the screen is decommissioned. One token shared across screens cannot
    be revoked without going dark everywhere, and `last_seen_ip` stops telling
    you which screen is calling

## Cryptography

| Purpose | Algorithm |
|:---|:---|
| Secrets at rest | AES-256-GCM, envelope encryption with per-record data keys |
| Control plane transport | TLS 1.3, mutual authentication |
| Development PKI | ECDSA P-256 |
| ACME account keys | ECDSA P-256 |
| Certificate keys | ECDSA P-256 (default) or RSA ≥ 2048 |
| Webhook signing | HMAC-SHA256 |
| Fingerprints | SHA-256 |

Post-quantum algorithms are not yet used. See the
[roadmap](ROADMAP.md#phase-6--crypto-agility-posture) for what is planned and
why it is not simply "issue ML-DSA certificates".

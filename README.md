CertPilot is built for the **central PKI team** — the group that owns the CA
hierarchy and answers for every certificate the organisation serves. One place
to watch every CA and certificate across any authority, public or private, with
automated renewal, CA health monitoring, deployment to the servers that serve
them, policy enforcement, and cryptographic posture reporting.

An expiring issuing CA is the failure that takes down everything it ever
signed, and no amount of certificate automation helps once that has happened.
So CertPilot watches authorities first and certificates second.

## Why

Certificate validity is collapsing. The CA/Browser Forum schedule
([ballot SC-081v3](https://cabforum.org/2025/04/11/ballot-sc081v3-introduce-schedule-of-reducing-validity-and-data-reuse-periods/))
takes maximum TLS certificate lifetime to **200 days in March 2026, 100 days in
March 2027, and 47 days in March 2029**, with domain validation reuse falling to
10 days on the same schedule. At 47 days, ten thousand certificates means
roughly 670 renewals a day, continuously. Spreadsheet-and-calendar tracking is
already broken.

The open-source ecosystem is good at *getting* a certificate — certbot, lego,
cert-manager and step-ca all do it well. What is missing is everything around
it: knowing what you already have, where it is installed, whether it complies
with your policy, and getting the renewed certificate onto the machine that
serves it. That gap is where the commercial tools live, and it is what CertPilot
is aimed at.

## Quick start

Requires Go 1.26+, Node 20+, and PostgreSQL 13+. No cloud account needed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/certpilot/certpilot.git
cd certpilot
make dev
```

That starts PostgreSQL, creates and migrates a `certpilot_dev` database,
generates a key encryption key once and keeps it, then runs the self-signed
gateway, the API and the frontend in one terminal — and registers the gateway as
a CA account so there is something to issue from. Ctrl-C stops all of it.

The API is on `:8080`, the frontend on `:3000`. Three pages are worth opening
first:

| | |
|:---|:---|
| `/` | The dashboard, with the expiry horizon |
| `/ca-health` | Every CA sorted by urgency |
| `/display` | Fullscreen wall view, for a screen nobody is sitting at |

On first start the core creates an administrator account and prints the password
once; `make dev` also writes it to `.certpilot/dev-admin`. There is no anonymous
mode, including locally.

Export `CERTPILOT_DB_URL` first to point at a database of your own. Without
PostgreSQL the core still starts, on an in-memory store discarded at exit.

[docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md) goes further: issuing a
certificate, pointing at a real CA, and putting it on a wall.

## What it does

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Issue** | ACME (RFC 8555) with `dns-01` and `http-01`, wildcards, External Account Binding, and ARI (RFC 9773). HashiCorp Vault PKI. A self-signed gateway for development |
| **Renew** | A durable queue with leases, an attempt log, and backoff that tightens as expiry approaches. Safe on N replicas with no leader election. A renewal deploys itself |
| **Watch** | Scheduled CA health sweeps with expiry thresholds, CRL freshness, and a real OCSP request whose signature and delegation are verified. Live updates over SSE |
| **Find** | Network and CIDR scans, Certificate Transparency logs, and cloud inventory across ACM, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud and Kubernetes secrets |
| **Deploy** | Signed webhook, host agent, AWS ACM, Azure Key Vault, F5 BIG-IP — in declared waves, so a canary is one target rather than one per worker |
| **Prove** | A hash-chained audit log, CNSA 2.0 conformance per certificate, and CycloneDX 1.6 CBOM export |

## Architecture

Every CA provider runs as its own process — a *gateway* — speaking gRPC to the
core. You run only the gateways you need, and adding support for a new CA means
writing one, in any language, without touching the core.

└────────────────┘      └────────────────┘      └────────────────┘
```

Separately, a **host agent** runs on the machines where certificates are served.
It generates its own private keys and never sends them anywhere — CertPilot
cannot produce them and does not claim to.

[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) explains the three decisions the
whole design follows from.

## Documentation

The **[API reference](https://certpilot.github.io/certpilot-docs/)** is
published as its own site, generated from the router so it cannot fall behind
the implementation.

## Security

Certificate private keys and CA credentials are encrypted before they reach the
database, using AES-256-GCM envelope encryption with a context string bound in
as additional authenticated data — so a ciphertext lifted from one column and
pasted into another fails to decrypt rather than quietly succeeding.

The core-to-gateway channel is mutually authenticated TLS 1.3. Agents sign every
request with Ed25519, and a replayed request is refused. Roles are held in
CertPilot's own table keyed on `(issuer, subject)`, so an identity provider says
who you are and CertPilot says what you may do; a claim in a token cannot
promote anyone.

Production mode refuses anonymous access, an insecure gateway channel, a
wildcard CORS origin, a missing auth method, and a missing database — by
refusing to start, not by warning.

[docs/security.md](docs/security.md) has the threat model and an honest list of
what is not covered. Report vulnerabilities per [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) —
please do not open a public issue.

## Development

```bash
make build        # every binary
make test         # every module
make test-race    # under the race detector
make test-store   # the store conformance suite, against a real PostgreSQL
make lint         # gofmt, go vet, staticcheck
make routes       # regenerate the API route table after changing the router
```

This is a Go workspace with six modules, so `go build ./...` from the root does
not work. Build from inside a module, or use the `make` targets.

## Contributing

Bug reports from running this against a real certificate authority are the most
useful thing right now, followed by gateways for CAs that do not have one yet —
Google Cloud CAS, AWS Private CA, DigiCert and Sectigo are all unwritten.

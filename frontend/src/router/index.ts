 * The first navigation guard in this app, doing two jobs.
 *
 * **Capturing the kiosk credential.** A wall display is launched at
 * `/display?display_token=cpd_…`; the token is moved into session storage and
 * removed from the address bar. A query string is the weakest place for a
 * secret — it reaches history, `Referer` headers, and any photograph of the
 * screen — and the kiosk relaunches from its own configured URL, so removing it
 * from the visible one costs nothing. See lib/displayToken.ts.
 *
 * **Not** gating `/display` on holding a token. The core decides whether a
 * credential is valid, and a client-side check could only guess: it would block
 * anonymous local evaluation, which the core permits on loopback, while giving a
 * revoked token a friendlier error than the honest one the server returns. The
 * view renders the server's rejection instead.

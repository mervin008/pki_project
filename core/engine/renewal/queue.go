	// This is the number that makes renewal backoff different from every other
	// kind. Ordinary exponential backoff assumes failures are transient,
	// retrying costs something, and there is no deadline. A certificate
	// violates the third outright: as expiry approaches, the cost of not
	// retrying grows without bound while the cost of retrying stays flat. So
	// the delay is bounded by the runway divided by this — with a day left it
	// retries hourly, with an hour left every few minutes, and the curve
	// tightens exactly when a fixed exponential would be backing off hardest.

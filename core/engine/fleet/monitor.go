// Package fleet watches the hosts that are supposed to be maintaining
// themselves.
//
// The failure this exists for is quiet and specific. An agent is installed on a
// host, works, and then stops — the service was disabled during an unrelated
// incident, the host was rebuilt from an older image, the process is in a crash
// loop nobody is looking at. Nothing breaks. The certificates on that host keep
// working right up until they expire, and on any screen that lists enrolled
// agents the host looks exactly like the ones that are fine.
//
// Silence is never success. It is the one answer this whole system refuses to
// read as an all-clear, and an agent is where that principle is easiest to get
// wrong: the absence of a heartbeat is, literally, nothing happening.

// Package discovery finds certificates nobody told CertPilot about.
//
// The distinction that shapes this package: a scan of a real estate returns
// mostly certificates the PKI team issued itself and already watches. Those
// rows are noise. The output that justifies running a scan at all is the
// endpoint serving something the inventory has never seen — because nothing
// will renew it, nobody is watching it expire, and no one can say who put it
// there. So every result carries a verdict, and the verdict is what the list is
// sorted, filtered, and alerted on.

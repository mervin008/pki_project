// certificate arrives here — issued, renewed, imported, found by a network
// scan, found in a CT log, found in a cloud store, found on a host by the agent
// — and a hook on each would be six places to forget. A sweep is one place, and
// it is correct for certificates that were already in the database before this
// existed.
//
// The claim is "never assessed, or assessed before the row last changed", so a
// steady state costs one query that returns nothing.
